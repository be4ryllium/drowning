                    <p>
                        As with most accidental methods of injury, drowning can be prevented with preemptive and active measures.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being taught how to swim by parents or school can drastically decrease the chance of drowning.</li>
                        <li>Fencing and guarding swimming pools can decrease the risk of someone falling in.</li>
                        <li>Looking out for your family and friends when they are in the water is very important to make sure that they don't start drowning.</li>
                        <li>Lifeguards established around a body of water can look out for potential drownings.</li>
                        <li>Not panicking or hyperventilating is important because you lose energy less quickly.</li>
                        <li>If you are not a very good swimmer, sticking to the shallow end of the pool will ensure a safer experience.</li>
                        <li>Learning CPR may save the life of someone who is drowning.</li>
